ARROW PERSPECTIVE GAME - TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
================================================

1. GAME OVERVIEW
---------------
The Arrow Perspective Game is a 3D-style game built using Pygame that simulates a third-person perspective where objects move towards the player. The game features a unique depth perception system where objects (gates and obstacles) appear to grow larger as they approach the player, creating an immersive 3D effect.

2. CORE GAME MECHANICS
---------------------
2.1 Perspective System
- Objects are rendered with varying sizes based on their distance from the player
- Distance is tracked using a distance variable that increases as objects move towards the player
- Objects are removed when they pass the player (distance > 1 or 2)

2.2 Gate System
- Gates appear in pairs (LEFT and RIGHT)
- Each gate pair has a unique pair_id
- Gates can only be collected once per pair
- Collecting gates affects the player's arrow count and score
- Gates are spawned at regular intervals (SPAWN_DELAY)

2.3 Obstacle System
- Obstacles appear randomly
- Must be avoided to prevent losing arrows
- Spawn timing is offset from gates (SPAWN_DELAY/2)
- Random variations in obstacle properties

2.4 Player Mechanics
- Player can move left and right
- Arrow count affects gameplay
- Score tracking for collected gates
- Collision detection with gates and obstacles

3. ARCHITECTURE
--------------
3.1 Main Components
- main.py: Entry point, handles game loop and display setup
- components/game.py: Core game logic and state management
- components/player.py: Player class and movement logic
- components/gate.py: Gate class and rendering
- components/obstacle.py: Obstacle class and behavior
- components/constants.py: Game constants and configuration

3.2 Class Structure
Game:
- Manages game state
- Handles object spawning
- Controls game speed
- Manages collisions
- Tracks collected pairs

Player:
- Handles movement
- Manages arrow count
- Tracks score
- Handles collision detection

Gate:
- Manages gate properties
- Handles rendering
- Tracks collection state
- Manages pair identification

Obstacle:
- Handles obstacle properties
- Manages rendering
- Controls obstacle behavior

4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------
4.1 Rendering System
- Uses Pygame's blit function for rendering
- Objects are scaled based on distance
- Background image is scaled to window size
- Double buffering for smooth rendering

4.2 Collision System
- Uses Pygame's Rect objects for collision detection
- Collision checks between player and gates/obstacles
- Pair-based collection system
- Distance-based object removal

4.3 Game Loop
- Main loop in main.py
- Event handling for keyboard input
- Continuous key press detection
- Frame rate control using clock.tick(FPS)

5. GAME STATE MANAGEMENT
-----------------------
5.1 State Variables
- Player position and arrow count
- Gate pairs and their collection status
- Obstacle positions and states
- Game speed and spawn timers
- Score tracking

5.2 State Updates
- Regular updates for object positions
- Collision detection and resolution
- Object spawning and removal
- Score and arrow count updates

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------
- Object pooling for gates and obstacles
- Efficient collision detection
- Optimized rendering with surface caching
- Frame rate control for consistent gameplay

7. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
---------------------
- Additional obstacle types
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Sound effects and background music
- High score system
- Visual effects for collisions and collection

8. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
------------------------
- Python 3.x
- Pygame 2.5.2
- Sufficient system resources for smooth rendering
- Keyboard input support

9. DEBUGGING AND TESTING
------------------------
- Print statements for game state tracking
- Collision visualization
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling for edge cases

10. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
--------------------
- Limited to 2D rendering with 3D perspective simulation
- Basic collision detection system
- Simple scoring mechanism
- No save/load functionality
